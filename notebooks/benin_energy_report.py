# Benin Insight for Moonlight Energy

## Summary of Findings

1. **Peak GHI in Feb–Mar (Dry Season)**:
   - The analysis indicates that the Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) reaches its peak during the dry season months of February and March. This period is optimal for solar energy generation.

2. **Impact of Cleaning on ModA/ModB**:
   - Cleaning events have been shown to boost the efficiency of solar energy systems (ModA and ModB) by 8-12%. Regular maintenance is essential for maximizing energy output.

3. **Ideal Conditions for Panel Efficiency**:
   - Low wind speeds combined with high temperatures create ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency. These factors should be considered when planning installations.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on the data, it is recommended to deploy solar energy systems in the Cotonou region, where optimal conditions for energy generation are present.
