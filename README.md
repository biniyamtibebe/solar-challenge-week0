# solar-challenge-week0

## OBJECTIVE 
 This project is part of the 10 Academy's AIM Week 0 Challenge. The goal is to prepare and analyze solar energy data from multiple countries to support region-ranking and decision-making tasks in renewable energy deployment. The work is divided into structured tasks. This README outlines the steps and deliverables completed for Task 1 and Task 2.

 ### Task 1: Git & Environment Setup

 1. **Initialize Repository**:
   - Create a GitHub repo named `solar-challenge-week0`.
   - Clone locally and set up a Python virtual environment.
   
2. **Branching & Commits**:
   - Create a branch called `setup-task`.
   - Commit at least 3 times with meaningful messages.
   - Include a `.gitignore` for data files.

3. **CI Setup**:
   - Create a GitHub Actions workflow for CI.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update `README.md` to document environment reproduction.

   ### Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA

1. **Create Branch**: `eda-<country>` (e.g., `eda-benin`).
2. **Perform EDA**:
   - Summary statistics and missing value reports.
   - Outlier detection and cleaning.
   - Time series analysis and correlation analysis.
   - Export cleaned data.

### Task 3: Cross-Country Comparison

1. **Create Branch**: `compare-countries`.
2. **Load Cleaned Datasets**.
3. **Metric Comparison**:
   - Create boxplots and summary tables.
   - Optional: Perform statistical testing.

### Bonus Task: Interactive Dashboard

1. **Create Branch**: `dashboard-dev`.
2. **Develop Streamlit App**:
   - Implement interactive visualizations.
   - Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Task Completion**: Successful execution of tasks.
- **Data Insights**: Quality and actionability of insights derived from EDA.
- **Dashboard Usability**: Intuitive design and functionality.
- **Git Hygiene**: Proper version control practices.

## Conclusion

This challenge is a unique opportunity to enhance your skills in data engineering and analytics while contributing to meaningful solar energy projects. Embrace the learning experience and strive to showcase your capabilities.
